			<p>Life is beautiful and can be viewed through many different eyes or through many different camera lenses. Whether you’re looking through a colored lense, sepia, monochrome etc, it’s simply beautiful and breathtaking. You could be staring at trees in the park, or looking at the horizon from a mountain top, or just staring at the street from your bedroom window. Whatever you’re doing, whenever you’re doing it, can be captured not just in your mind, but with a camera.<br>
			<br>
			At <b>Black</b><span style="color: red">&</span><b>White</b>, we believe in capturing moments and making them last for a lifetime. Are you clad in a flawless white gown, feet adorned in snow-white-like glass slippers with a loving smile on your face, waiting to say those magic words to the groom on your wedding day? Are you counting your blessings while looking at your child, clad in his graduation gown, giving his valedictory speech on the podium, oblivious of the architectural masterpieces in the school compound around you? Look at the adorable innocent little human in your arms, sleeping peacefully, even with the guests all around smiling at her adorable face. These and lots more are moments that happen once and should be captured, that is what we are good at. We understand moments and their significance, thus we look out for those moments and trap them with the lense pf our cameras just so you can always have them.
